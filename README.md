# Asahi VDM Tool

Extension of the tipd kernel module for VDM functionality on M chipset Macs. Allows for rebooting and enabling UART on supported target Mac devices (and some iPads/iPhones).

## Currently working:
	* Target reboot
	* Sending the CD321x unlock key

## TODO:
	* Unlock key is currently hard-coded (for M1 MBA), calculate from model number
 	* Extend for UART/debug support
